                    <p>
                        Rules: I carry a dollar coin in my pocket and all day any decisions i have to make between 2 options are decided by flipping it...
                        This game was actually extremely difficult for me. I found it very difficult to let go of my autonomy, and struggled to give things up like ... Should I make eggs for breakfast? Suddenly I was more sure of my decisions than ever before, and outraged that a silly coin could replace my reasoning based on what I know about myself. This unexpected personal reaction led me to consider this exercise in giving up control very important to someone like me who likes to feel in complete control of my life.  
                        Examples of decisions I flipped the coin for: 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Which seat to sit in? Tails
                        <br>
                        Which drink to order? Heads
                        <br>
                        Which scarf to wear? Heads
                    </p>
